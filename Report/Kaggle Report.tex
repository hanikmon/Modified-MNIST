\begin{abstract}
This paper provides the report for the Kaggle Competition (assignment 4) of COMP 551 using the provided Modified MNIST dataset. The dataset includes a set of 8-bit grayscale images that include 2 or 3 digits of different sizes that are rotated and scaled from the classic MNIST dataset. The goal is to design Machine Learning algorithms that identify the biggest digit in each image. Several algorithms have been used in the report. First, the logistic regression and linear SVM are used which lead to relatively lower precisions. Second, a forward neural network completely developed by the team was implemented. Finally, a convoluted neural network was trained and tested on the preprocessed dataset which showed the best performance.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

The MNIST database \cite{MNISTcreators} is a set of handwritten images that is popular for training and testing of Machine Learning algorithms \cite{wiki:MNIST}.

\section{PREPROCESSING}
The provided images in the Modified MNIST include 3 numbers that are rotated and scaled from the MNIST dataset and are written on random backgrounds.
Some samples of the train dataset with their associated outputs are shown in Figure \ref{fig:original}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/originalDataset.pdf}  % The printed column width is 8.4 cm.
		\caption{25 Random Samples of the original train dataset}
		\label{fig:original}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
 The format for the images is 8-bit grayscale image, thus each pixel has 256 shades of gray represented by numbers 0 (black) to 255 (white) as shown in Figure \ref{fig:maxeig2}.

	
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/21stepwide8bit.jpg}  % The printed column width is 8.4 cm.
		\caption{8-bit Grayscale Shades of Gray}
		\label{fig:maxeig2}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Before, the data are used for training, the following preprocessing steps are used.

\subsection{Thresholding} 
Since the numbers in the dataset match the 255 shade, a simple idea for preprocessing is to use \textit{image thresholding}. 
The idea of thresholding is to compare the pixel values of the input image $f$ with some threshold $T$ and make a binary decision for the output binary image $g$ as below
\begin{align}
g(i,j) = \begin{cases}
1 & f(i,j)\ge T\\
0 & f(i,j)\le T
\end{cases}
\end{align}
for all $i, j$ where $i, j$ represent the coordinates of the $ij$\textsuperscript{th} pixel \cite{bovik2009essential}.

The output of this filter is shown in Figure \ref{fig:thresholded}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/thresholdDataset.pdf}  % The printed column width is 8.4 cm.
		\caption{Output of thresholding on images from Figure \ref{fig:original}}
		\label{fig:thresholded}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Median Filter}
The output of this filter on thresholded images are shown in Figure \ref{fig:thresholdmed}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/thresholdmedDataset.pdf}  % The printed column width is 8.4 cm.
		\caption{Output of median filter on thresholded images from Figure \ref{fig:thresholded}}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Biggest Number}
The output of this filter on thresholded images are shown in Figure \ref{fig:biggest}.

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

%

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{APPENDIX}

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word ÒacknowledgmentÓ in America is without an ÒeÓ after the ÒgÓ. Avoid the stilted expression, ÒOne of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .Ó  Instead, try ÒR. B. G. thanksÓ. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
